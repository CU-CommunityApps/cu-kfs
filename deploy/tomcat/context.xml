    CU Customizations:

    * Added settings for the "path" and "reloadable" attributes, as well as a DOCTYPE declaration.
    * Added "CookieProcessor" settings to fix some Shibboleth integration issues.
    * Backported FINP-7556 resource cache fix from the 2021-05-13 patch.
    * Backported FINP-7585 context.xml bundling fix from the 2021-05-27 patch (which moved this file
          to a new location and required adjusting the POM's maven-war-plugin configuration).

     The default value is 10240 kbytes, even when not added to context.xml.
     We are increasing it to avoid issues with Tomcat not being able to cache web resources and logging a bunch of
     warning messages.
