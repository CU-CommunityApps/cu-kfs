  <!-- CU Customization: backport FINP-7556 changes from the 2021-05-13 patch.
        
     The default value is 10240 kbytes, even when not added to context.xml.
     We are increasing it to avoid issues with Tomcat not being able to cache web resources and logging a bunch of
     warning messages.
