    CU Customization: Explicitly change the database platform attribute from "MySQL" to "Oracle9i" instead.
    KualiCo removed the ConfigurableSequenceManager class and is now using a MySql specific class. We copied this in our CU base code to continue using it as we are running an Oracle database.
