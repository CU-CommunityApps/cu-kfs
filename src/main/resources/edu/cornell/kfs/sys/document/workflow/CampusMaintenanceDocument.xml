    CU Customization:
    Renamed this file from the original "FINP-5331.xml" financials file.
    
    The original XML file in financials had the "CAMP" and "CMPT" doc types together in the same file.
    We've separated the two out into their own dedicated files for easier tracking.
    
    We also fixed a minor typo in the "CAMP" doc type's help definition URL.
